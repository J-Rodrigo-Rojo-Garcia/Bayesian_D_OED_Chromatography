This is the Github repository of the article: 
"Surrogate model for Bayesian optimal experimental design in chromatography"

You need to install:

1) Matlab 2023a or more new versions
2) Fortran 95
3) OpenMP
4) Python3 and libraries: "Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlib"

There are three folders, for 8, 15 and 20 time measurements.

- Run in Matlab for each folder the script called: "Scripts_Matlab.m"
- It can take several hours
- Once you run the scripts in Matlab for each experiment, you can visualize the plots of the data with scripts in python.
